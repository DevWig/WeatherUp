# WeatherUp
This is a fully functional weather app programmed entirely in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. It is pulling in weather information through an API at OpenWeather.


I have removed the API key that was used to develop this project.
If you would like to use this app, you can acquire your own API key at https://openweathermap.org/api.
